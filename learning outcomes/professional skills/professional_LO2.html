            <p>Throughout working for the assignments that were given, be it individual or group project, I always remained 
                curious throughout the problem-solving process. I demonstrated this by actively asking for feedback from the 
                teachers, and sometimes during the feedback sessions, I asked them for solutions or advice on the problems I 
                encountered while doing my assignment, which I could not find the solution to myself. Before asking the teachers 
                for solution, however, everytime I encounter difficulties with my work, I take advantage of using ChatGPT to look 
                for answers to the questions I had, and I also often search for solutions in w3schools. Then I took notes of the 
                information I got so if next time I encounter the same problem again, and need some help to refresh my memory,
                I can look through my notes again.</p>

            <p>I learned how to remain curious and ask the right questions to get the solutions to the problems in the assignments.
                I also learned how it's important to take notes of what I got from searching for the solutions, and the solution
                itself, for it could help me refresh my memory again if I were to encounter the same problem again in my future 
                assignments.</p>
