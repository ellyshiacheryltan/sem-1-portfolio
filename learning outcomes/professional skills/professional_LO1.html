            <p>For my group project I am in charge of maintaining the planning and task 
            organization tool that we use, which is Notion. For every feedback the group
            received from teachers, I write them down for the meeting discussion, then
            after every meeting, I update the "To Do" section in the Notion Workspace,
            crossing out the tasks that are done and add new tasks that must be done. I
            also keep track of the deadlines for our group project.</p>
            <iframe src="Group-Notion.html" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
            <p>Then for the group project we also made a project planning chart that we sticked to, to organize our work more and 
                to have a clear overview of what has to be done in each sprints.

            <p>Through this work I learned how to do a future-oriented organisation, by planning and dividing tasks
                among the group, and also keeping track of the plans and each member's progress on their tasks. I also
                learned how to familiarize myself with thinking ahead everytime and plan well according to the time given
                to complete the assignments.</p>
